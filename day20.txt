1. we have to rename all the jsx file into tsx
2. then npm install i.e 
----> "npm install -D typescript @react-native/typescript-config @types/jest @types/react @types/react-test-renderer"
3. then a command that creates a file called tsconfig.json
----> "npx tsc --init"
4. do the changes in that file i.e remove all inside compilerOptions{} and paste the below
    "target":"es5",
    "jsx":"react-jsx",
    "module":"esnext",
    "moduleResolution":"node",
    "strict":true
5. Then just create the file and in main.tsx it imported as app.jsx change it and add !

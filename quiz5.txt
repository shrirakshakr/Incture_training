A component fetches remote data upon mounting and receives new props affecting its data source. Describe a robust pattern for handling both initial and subsequent fetches while preventing memory leaks.
(1 Point)

Use componentDidMount for initial fetch, componentDidUpdate for prop changes, handle cleanup in componentWillUnmount, and use a flag or AbortController to prevent setting state after unmounting.

Use getDerivedStateFromProps for all fetching.

Dispatch fetch in constructor, handle abort in render.

Use only componentWillUnmount.

17.Which method cannot access this.props or this.state?
(1 Point)

render

getDerivedStateFromProps

componentDidUpdate

componentWillUnmount
18.In what scenario could getDerivedStateFromProps lead to redundant or stale state, and how would you avoid it?
(1 Point)

When directly copying props to state; avoid by only updating state if props and state differ.

When updating state every render; avoid by unmounting component.

When using componentWillUnmount; avoid by using getSnapshotBeforeUpdate.

When not binding methods; avoid by binding in constructor.
